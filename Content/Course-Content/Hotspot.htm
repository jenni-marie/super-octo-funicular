                <p>Hotspot pages can be a great way how to depict graphs or schematic illustrations. You can use these pages whenever there is a need for a user to click and reveal extra information. Hotspots, for example, you could use for providing the user with extra tips.

                <p>Click on the round hotspots to reveal a popup with extra information. All text boxes can be easily changed as well as images in a hotspot page. It is also possible to move around the hotspots, their position is not locked.

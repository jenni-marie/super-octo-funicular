                <h1>Text Image</h1>
                <p>The most common eLearning template used is a template with a text box and image. Both text boxes and images can be easily altered in Flare. Images can be changed externally as well by changing the image files in their folders, but, remember, you need to retain the original image file names.</p>

                <p>Even though this is not a very interactive template page it provides some basic information about the main ideas in your course and gives it a nice look. The main beauty of it is that it is very easy to set it up, all you need to do is to choose an image and write in the page’s text box.</p>
